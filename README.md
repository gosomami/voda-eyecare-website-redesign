# VODA Eyecare Website Redesign

## Overview
This project involved redesigning the official website for **VODA Eyecare**, a local optometry clinic in Suwanee, GA.  
The goal was to create a modern, mobile-friendly website that reflects the clinic’s brand identity and interior design, ensuring a seamless user experience from online discovery to in-person visits.

## Problem Statement
The original website had:
- Branding inconsistency between the website and the clinic’s physical interior design
- Too many pages and scattered information, making navigation difficult
- Limited focus on the clinic’s core services and values
- Lack of fully responsive design for mobile and desktop

## Goals
- Align website design with the clinic’s branding and interior aesthetics
- Streamline the site structure by removing unnecessary pages and content
- Focus attention on key services and essential information
- Ensure a fully responsive design for both mobile and desktop devices
- Create a cohesive experience from online interactions to in-clinic visits

## Process
1. **Brand Alignment**  
   - Developed a comprehensive branding guide, starting with the clinic’s logo  
   - Applied brand colors, typography, and imagery across the website  
   - Matched digital design elements with physical interior cues  

2. **Content Audit & Simplification**  
   - Analyzed existing website content and page hierarchy  
   - Removed redundant pages and outdated information  
   - Reorganized content to emphasize high-priority services  

3. **Responsive Redesign**  
   - Created layouts optimized for mobile, tablet, and desktop  
   - Used responsive typography and image scaling for consistency  

4. **Consistency Across Touchpoints**  
   - Designed the website to complement the in-person patient experience  
   - Ensured smooth visual and functional transition from online browsing to physical visit  

## Deliverables
- New responsive website design
- Updated site architecture and content hierarchy
- Branding guide (logo, colors, typography) applied to web and physical space
- Before/After comparison of old and new designs

## Expected Impact
- Stronger brand recognition and trust
- Simplified user journey → quicker access to essential information
- Cohesive experience from first online impression to in-person visit
- Increased engagement and positive first impressions for new patients

## HCI Connection
This project aligns with Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) principles by:
- **Cross-Channel Experience Design**: Connecting online interactions (website) with offline experiences (clinic visits) for a unified journey.
- **Information Architecture Optimization**: Reducing unnecessary pages and focusing content to help users achieve goals efficiently.
- **Responsive Interaction Design**: Ensuring seamless usability across devices without sacrificing content accessibility.
- **Cognitive Load Reduction**: Organizing information to minimize mental effort for patients making decisions.
